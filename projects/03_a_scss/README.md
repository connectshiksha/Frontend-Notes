# Minimal SCSS Project

This is a minimal setup for using SCSS (Sassy CSS) in a web project. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine as it includes npm, which is necessary for managing the packages.


## Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary npm package for SCSS:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install Sass, which is required for compiling SCSS files.


## Usage

To start using SCSS in your project, follow these steps:

1. Write SCSS: Edit your SCSS files located in the scss folder.

2. Compile SCSS to CSS: Run the following command to compile your SCSS files to CSS:

```bash
npx sass scss/styles.scss css/styles.css
```

This command compiles the styles.scss file into a styles.css file inside the css folder.

3. View Your Project: Open the index.html file in a web browser to see your changes.
