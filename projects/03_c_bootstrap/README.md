# Bootstrap "Hello World" Project

This project demonstrates a basic setup for a web page using Bootstrap, the popular front-end framework. Bootstrap provides a convenient way to create responsive, mobile-first web projects.

## Prerequisites

What you need to run this project:

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- A text editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text, Atom)

## Built With

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - The web framework used for easy and efficient UI design. Bootstrap's responsive grid system and pre-designed components help in quickly designing visually appealing web pages.

## Customizing

Start by editing the `index.html` to include various Bootstrap components such as buttons, navbars, or cards. For more advanced customization, modify the Bootstrap variables in a custom stylesheet or directly in the LESS/SASS source files (if you're using them). Explore the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/) for detailed guidance on components, layout, content, utilities, and more.
