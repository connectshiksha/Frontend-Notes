# Vanilla JavaScript Examples

This repository is a curated collection of Vanilla JavaScript examples, each housed in its own subdirectory. These examples are crafted for educational purposes, providing a hands-on approach to learning JavaScript in its purest form, without any libraries or frameworks.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several subdirectories, each dedicated to a specific JavaScript concept or functionality. Inside each directory, you will find three key files: 
- `index.html`: The HTML document providing the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file used to style the HTML content.
- `app.js`: The Vanilla JavaScript file where the main logic and functionality are implemented.

### Directory Naming Convention

The naming of each directory is reflective of the JavaScript concept it demonstrates. For instance:
- `dom_manipulation/` for DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation.
- `event_handling/` for handling user events.
- `ajax/` for AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) requests.
- And so on.

This approach simplifies identifying and accessing the desired example.

## How to Use

To get the most out of these examples, follow these instructions:

1. **Explore an Example:**
   - Open the cloned repository on your system.
   - Navigate to the example directory you're interested in (e.g., `dom_manipulation/`).

2. **Run and Modify the Example:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the example in action.
   - Use a text editor or IDE to modify the `app.js` and `styles.css` files. This is a crucial step for experimenting with JavaScript and observing how it interacts with HTML and CSS.

## Learning Through Experimentation

Editing the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files and seeing the results is an excellent way to understand JavaScript's capabilities and behavior. Experiment with the code to see how changes in JavaScript affect the web page and its styling.
