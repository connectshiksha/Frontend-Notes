# CSS Examples

This repository contains a series of CSS examples, each within its own subdirectory, tailored for educational purposes. The examples are designed to provide practical insights into various aspects of CSS, ideal for those looking to enhance their web design skills.

## Repository Structure

Each subdirectory in this repository corresponds to a different CSS concept. Inside each directory, you'll find two primary files: `index.html` and `styles.css`. The `index.html` file contains the HTML structure, while `styles.css` includes the corresponding CSS styles.

### Directory Naming Convention

The directories are named to reflect the CSS concept they demonstrate, such as:
- `flexbox/` for Flexbox layouts.
- `grid/` for CSS Grid layouts.
- `animation/` for CSS animations.
- And more.

This naming convention helps in easily identifying and navigating to the desired example.

## How to Use

To effectively utilize these CSS examples, please follow the steps below:

1. **Select an Example:**
   - Open the cloned repository on your computer.
   - Choose the example you're interested in (e.g., `flexbox/`).

2. **View and Edit the Files:**
   - Open the `index.html` and `styles.css` files in a web browser to see the example in action.
   - Use a text editor or IDE (like Visual Studio Code, Atom, etc.) to modify and experiment with the HTML and CSS. Observing how changes in the CSS affect the layout and style of the HTML is a key learning experience.

## Experimentation and Learning

You are encouraged to edit and tweak the HTML and CSS files. Experimentation is a crucial part of learning CSS, and modifying the code to see different effects and layouts can deepen your understanding of CSS properties and techniques.
