# HTML Examples

This repository contains a collection of HTML files, each located in its own subdirectory, designed for educational purposes. These examples cover various HTML concepts and are intended to provide practical, hands-on learning experiences.

## Repository Structure

Each subdirectory within this repository represents a different HTML example. For instance, the `table/` directory contains an HTML file demonstrating how to create tables in HTML.

### Directory Naming Convention

The directories are named according to the HTML concept they illustrate. For example:
- `table/` for table elements.
- `form/` for HTML forms.
- And so on.

Each directory contains a single HTML file named `index.html`, which is the focal point of the example.

## How to Use

To use these HTML examples, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to an Example Directory:**
   - Navigate to the directory of the example you want to explore (e.g., `table/`).

2. **Open the HTML File:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the example.
   - Alternatively, you can edit and view the `index.html` file in a code editor (like VSCode, Sublime Text, etc.) to modify and understand the code better.

## Editing and Experimenting

Feel free to edit the HTML files to experiment and understand the concepts better. Modifying the code and observing the changes in the browser is a great way to learn HTML.
