## CSS Frameworks and Preprocessors

CSS preprocessors and frameworks are two important tools in a web developer's toolbox that can help streamline the process of building websites. CSS preprocessors allow developers to use new functionality that is typically borrowed from another programming language, while frameworks provide pre-written app skeletons and collections of built-in functionality that allow developers to avoid having to write all of the code from scratch.

## CSS Preprocessors

CSS preprocessors are scripting languages that extend standard CSS features with new functionality borrowed from other programming languages. Variables, nesting, inheritance, mixins, functions, and mathematical operations are common examples. While preprocessors don't introduce anything that can't be accomplished with plain CSS, they offer a more efficient way of doing things.

The two most common preprocessors are:

* [SASS / SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [LESS](https://lesscss.org/)

### An outline of common features

Let's delve into some of the most prevalent CSS preprocessor features and see how they stack up against CSS4, the latest iteration of CSS.

#### Variables

Variables facilitate the use of named values in different sections of the code. For instance, if you've utilized 'red' in various properties and later opt for 'blue', with a variable, you can alter the value in a singular location, as opposed to tracking down each instance individually.

CSS:

```css
:root {
  --important-color: red;
}

body {
  color: var(--important-color);
}
```

SCSS:

```scss
$important-color: red;

body {
  color: $important-color;
}
```

LESS:

```less
@important-color: red;

body {
  color: @important-color;
}
```

#### Inheritance

Inheritance copies all definitions from one selector to another.

CSS (Using @apply):

```css
.parent {
  color: red;
}

.child {
  @apply .parent;
}
```

SCSS:

```scss
%parent {
  color: red;
}

child {
  @extend %parent;
}
```

LESS:

```less
.parent {
  color: red;
}

child {
  .parent();
}
```

#### Nesting

Nesting provides a more structured and readable way to write styles for nested elements. While CSS lacks a direct equivalent, the same effect can be achieved using multiple nested selectors.

SASS / LESS:

```css
.parent {
  .child {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

#### Mathematical operations

Mathematical operations enable dynamic value assignment based on another value, computed in real-time.

CSS:

```css
body {
  font-size: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```

SCSS / LESS:

```scss
body {
  font-size: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```

#### Functions

Functions are named sets of instructions that take arguments and return a computed value. They provide a way to perform complex calculations or transformations on CSS properties.

CSS:

Available functions include:

* `rgb()`
* `min()`
* `max()`

```css
body {
  background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
  background-color: min(rgb(255, 255, 255), rgb(0, 0, 0));
  background-color: max(rgb(255, 255, 255), rgb(0, 0, 0));
}
```

SCSS / LESS: 

Available functions include:

* `lighten()`
* `darken()`
* `saturate()`

```scss
body {
  background-color: lighten(rgb(255, 255, 255), 10%);
  background-color: darken(rgb(255, 255, 255), 10%);
  background-color: saturate(rgb(255, 255, 255), 10%);
}
```

#### Mixins

Mixins are reusable blocks of code that can be included in multiple CSS rules. They allow for writing DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code, avoiding repetition.

CSS (Using @apply, somewhat limited):

```css
@custom-media --small-viewport (max-width: 30em);

@media (--small-viewport) {
  /* Rules here */
}
```

SCSS:

```scss
@mixin small-viewport {
  @media (max-width: 30em) {
    @content;
  }
}

@include small-viewport {
  /* Rules here */
}
```

LESS:

```less
.small-viewport(@rules) {
  @media (max-width: 30em) {
    @rules();
  }
}

.small-viewport({
  /* Rules here */
});
```

#### Conditionals and Loops

Conditionals and loops are not available in standard CSS. They allow for more dynamic and programmable stylesheets in preprocessors.

SCSS (Using conditionals and loops):

```scss
@for $i from 1 through 3 {
  .item-#{$i} { width: 100px * $i; }
}

@if $theme == 'dark' {
  body { background: black; }
} @else {
  body { background: white; }
}
```

LESS (Similar capabilities):

```less
.loop(@counter) when (@counter > 0) {
  .item-@{counter} { width: 100px * @counter; }
  .loop(@counter - 1);
}
.loop(3);

@theme: dark;
.body(@theme) when (@theme = dark) {
  background: black;
},
.body(@theme) when (@theme = light) {
  background: white;
}
.body(@theme);
```

## CSS Frameworks

There are a variety of CSS frameworks available. They provide the developer with a collection of built-in functionality, allowing them to avoid having to write all of the code from scratch. 

### What are frameworks?

A software framework is a pre-written app skeleton on which you may further develop. It is a collection of files and folders to which you may modify as well as add your files and folders. A framework addresses following development issues:

* We don't want to start projects from scratch every time. A framework offers boilerplate code. 
* We want a consistent method of spreading functions across files and directories. A framework provides a structure for your project.
* We want consistency in the way our UI elements are styled. A framework provides a consistent style guide.
* When writing functions, we need rules to follow. A framework offers us with numerous examples that we may strive to emulate. 

### Why are so many frameworks developed?

There are an infinite number of methods to mix multiple styles to build UI components. Aside from obvious aspects like margin widths and colors, here are also considerations such as how many fonts to use, what different button states there are, and how intuitive forms look. The comunity behind the CSS is also huge. For these two reasons alone, there will undoubtedly be numerous attempts to develop CSS frameworks. Different people find different things useful, and different styles appeal to different people.

### Examples

Among commonly used CSS frameworks are:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Picnic CSS](https://picnicss.com/)
- [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com)
- [Foundation](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/)

## Common elements of all frameworks

Most popular frameworks adress some common issues. If you decide to not use any framework in your project you may want to think about how you want to approach those issues. 

### Viewport and resets

Viewport ensures that your site has no horizontal scroll - the full site will be visible, and users will not have to zoom on mobile to see the content. Put the following line in the head section of your HTML documment:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```

Every browser renders content a little differently (this also changes between different versions of the same browser). To unify the rendering there are two common strategies:

* <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">Reset</a> which removes all built-in browser styling.
* <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">Normalize</a> which tries to unify the built-in browser styling.

To use Reset in your project, add the following line to the head section of your HTML document: 
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css">
```

To use Normalize in your project, add the following line to the head section of your HTML document: 

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/7.0.0/normalize.css">
```

Additionally you may want to reset the border box:

```css
html {
	box-sizing: border-box;
}

*,
*:before,
*:after {
	box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

### Layout

The most common method to layout a website is to split the content into columns (usually two or three).
Then we have a lot of options.
Depending on the screen size, all or some columns may shrink.
Columns can be transformed into rows if they reach a certain minimum width.

```css
.column {
	float: left;
	width: 33.33%;
}

.row:after {
	content: "";
	display: table;
	clear: both;
}

@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
	.column {
		width: 100%;
	}
}
```

Background colors and styles, should extend the width of the full viewport.
To improve readability, content should normally be limited to a specific width. 

```css
.container {
	margin: 0 auto;
	padding: 0 8px;
	max-width: 800px;
}
```

### Breakpoints

Breakpoints are defined using media queries.
A breakpoint specifies the pixel width at which the content will collapse, for as when a navigation bar transitions from horizontal to vertical display or a grid breaks into specified parts.


The mobile first technique is one of the most common ways to define breakpoints.
In that approach, we first specify how our website will look on small mobile screens, then we specify breakpoints and their behavior on larger screens.
The general CSS template looks like this: 

```css
/* Styles for mobile devices */

@media screen and (min-width: 800px) {
	/* Styles for laptops and PCs */
}
```

### Navigation

One of the most crucial aspects of the website is navigation. Users will not explore your site if it is not intuitive to them. Consider the following:

* Is it better to show navigation horizontally or vertically?
* Should you go with the hamburger menu?
* How do I show submenu items? 

## Bootstrap

* A popular, open-source front-end framework for designing websites and web applications
* Developed by Twitter in 2011 by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton
* Utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive and mobile-first designs

### Including Bootstrap in the project

* Add the following code in the `<head>` section of the HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

* Now Boostrap is already working in your project.
* Bootstrap will apply styles to some elements automatically, such as `<body>`, `<h1>`, and `<button>`
* To apply other styles, set the appropriate `class` attribute in the HTML code
	
### Containers

* Containers are the basic building blocks for Bootstrap.
* Use the `container` class in `<div>` tags:
  
```html
<div class="container">
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</div>
```

### Column layout 

* Use the 12-column layout system for designing responsive layouts:

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h1>Hello World</h1>
        </div>
        <!-- Add more columns as needed -->
    </div>
</div>
```

### Typography

* Use Bootstrap's typography classes for headings, paragraphs, lists, and more:

```html
<h1 class="display-1">Display Heading 1</h1>
<p class="lead">This is a leading paragraph.</p>
<small class="text-muted">This is a small, muted text.</small>
```

### Forms

* Create responsive and styled forms using Bootstrap's form classes:

```html
<div class="container">
    <form>
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="exampleInputEmail1">Email address</label>
            <input type="email" class="form-control" id="exampleInputEmail1" aria-describedby="emailHelp" placeholder="Enter email">
            <small id="emailHelp" class="form-text text-muted">We'll never share your email with anyone else.</small>
        </div>
        <!-- Add more form elements as needed -->
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
    </form>
</div>
```

### Typography

* Bootstrap offers various components, such as navigation bars, cards, modals, and alerts:

```html
<!-- Example: Navigation bar -->
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
  <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Navbar</a>
  <!-- Add more navigation elements as needed -->
</nav>
```

### Customization

*  Customize Bootstrap's built-in styles using SASS/SCSS, modify color schemes, fonts, and component styles
*  Use build tools like Webpack, Grunt, or Gulp to streamline the customization process

```html
// Example: Customizing the primary color
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #ff6347
);

@import "bootstrap";
```
