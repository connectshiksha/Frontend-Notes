## What is frontend development? üåê

Frontend development, also known as client-side development, refers to the process of building the user interface and visual elements of a website or application. It is responsible for creating the look, feel, and overall user experience of a product. Frontend developers work with technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web pages that are visually appealing, responsive, and interactive.

## Prerequisites üõ†

The following prerequisites are needed:

1. A modern web browser and code editor (such as Google Chrome and Visual Studio Code, respectively)
1. For projects that use JavaScript frameworks (sections 5.a, 5.b, and 5.c), you will need to have NPM installed on your system. This requirement will be noted in the README file for each respective project.

Please note that some projects may have additional requirements or dependencies. It is recommended that you consult the README file for each project for more information.

## Getting Started üëç

The `projects` directory in the root of this repository contains multiple independent subprojects that cover various frontend development topics. Each project is designed to illustrate the implementation of a specific topic, and may have its own specific instructions and dependencies.

To get started with a project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/connectshiksha/Frontend-Notes.git`
1. Navigate to the projects directory: `cd Frontend-Notes/projects`
1. Choose a project to work on and navigate to its directory: `cd 01_html/image`
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view and interact with the project.

Happy coding, and keep coming back for more goodies!
